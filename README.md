  # AES: ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD üîê
</div>

> This project provides a Verilog implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm
> as a part of our Advanced Logic Design course.

## Project Overview:
The cipher.v module implements the core AES algorithm. It performs the following steps:

- _Initial Round:_ Takes the plain text as input.
- _Key Schedule:_ Expands the provided key into round keys using a specific algorithm (not included in this base code).
- _Multiple Rounds:_ Iterates through a defined number of rounds, performing the following operations in each round:
- _AddRoundKey_: XORs the current state with the round key.
- _SubBytes:_ Substitutes each byte in the state with a predefined value (requires sub_bytes.v).
- _ShiftRows:_ Cyclically shifts the rows of the state (requires shift_rows.v).
- _MixColumns:_ Applies a specific linear transformation to the state columns (requires mix_columns.v).
- _Final Round:_ Similar to the regular rounds but skips the MixColumns step.
- _Output:_ The final state after all rounds is the encrypted text.

### Customization:
- The `Nk` and `Nr` parameters in cipher.v control the key size (Nk words) and number of rounds (Nr = Nk + 6).
- You can modify the data width (currently 128 bits) by adjusting the wire sizes throughout the code.
